To interact with the VirusShare API, you can use the Python library PyVirusShare. This library is specifically designed for VirusShare API v2, allowing users to fetch information about malware samples by hash and download samples directly if authorized.

## Installation
You can install PyVirusShare from PyPI using:

`pip install PyVirusShare`

## Basic Usage
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the library:

```python
from virusshare import VirusShare

# Initialize with your VirusShare API key
v = VirusShare('<your_api_key>')

# Get information about a specific hash
result = v.info('your_sample_hash')
print(result)

# Download a sample
v.download('your_sample_hash', '/path/to/destination')
```

## Usage for script
```python
python download_from_virusShare.py hash_file.txt /path/to/destination_folder

```

For further details on available methods like info, download, and others, refer to the library's documentation on GitHub or PyPI for additional guidance. This library provides functionality for rate limiting and error handling, which is helpful for automated malware sample analysis.
